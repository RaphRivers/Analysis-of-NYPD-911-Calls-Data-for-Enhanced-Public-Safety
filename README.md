The dataset contains data for calls for service to NYPD's 911 system. "This dataset documents entries into the NYPD 911 system, ICAD. The data is collected from the ICAD system, which call takers and dispatchers use to communicate with callers and the NYPD. Each record represents an entry into the system. The data includes entries generated by members of the public as well as self-initiated entries by NYPD Members of Service. The data can be used for issues being responded to by the NYPD".
